# student-debt-project
Computer Science Class Project 2020

This project uses data from Statistic Canada to determine the average undergraduate student debt by each province/territory and compares it with the national average. I created several data types and functions to aid in the data analysis. There were 4 test data files created during this project to ensure the functions are optimal.
